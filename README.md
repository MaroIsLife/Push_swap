## Introduction

This project comprises an interesting case study regarding sorting algorithms and its performances, The task is simple: given a sequence of random numbers disposed in a stack data structure (**stack A**), sort them with the help of an empty auxiliary stack (**stack B**) and a set of specific stack operations. The operations allowed are described as follows, as written in our task:

- **`sa`** : **swap a** - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- **`sb`** : **swap b** - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- **`ss`** : **`sa`** and **`sb`** at the same time.
- **`pa`** : **push a** - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if B is empty.
- **`pb`** : **push b** - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if A is empty.
- **`ra`** : **rotate a** - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **`rb`** : **rotate b** - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **`rr`** : **`ra`** and **`rb`** at the same time.
- **`rra`** : **reverse rotate a** - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **`rrb`** : **reverse rotate b** - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **`rrr`** : **`rra`** and **`rrb`** at the same time.

### The Push Swap Program

The main objective of the `push_swap` is to print to `STDOUT` the instructions required to sort the **stack A**, which must be given as the program's argument. Each instruction must be followed by a line break (`\n`). The **stack A** must be sorted with its lowest element at the top, while **stack B** must be empty.

```shell
$ ARG='4 0 1 3 2'; ./push_swap $ARG
